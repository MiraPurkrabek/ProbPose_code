## üìã Overview

ProbPose introduces a probabilistic framework for human pose estimation, focusing on reducing false positives by predicting keypoint presence probabilities and handling out-of-image keypoints. It also introduces the new Ex-OKS metric to evaluate models on false positive predictions.

Key contributions:
- **Presence probability** concept that distinguishes keypoint presence from confidence
- **ProbPose**: top-down model for out-of-image keypoints estimation
- **OKSLoss adapted for dense predictions** in risk minimization formulation
- **Ex-OKS evaluation metric** penalizing false positive keypoints
- **CropCOCO dataset** for out-of-image and false positive keypoints evaluation

## üöÄ Installation

This project is built on top of [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose). Please refer to the [MMPose installation guide](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for detailed setup instructions.

Basic installation steps:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mirapurkrabek/ProbPose_code.git ProbPose/
cd ProbPose

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## üéÆ Demo

### Single Image Demo

Run the following command to test ProbPose on a single image:

```bash
python demo/image_demo.py \
demo/resources/CropCOCO_single_example.jpg \
configs/body_2d_keypoint/topdown_probmap/coco/td-pm_ProbPose-small_8xb64-210e_coco-256x192.py \
path/to/pre-trained/weights.pth \
--out-file demo/results/CropCOCO_single_example.jpg \
--draw-heatmap
```

Expected result (click for full size):  
<a href="demo/resources/single_demo_result.jpg">
    <img src="demo/resources/single_demo_result.jpg" alt="Single Image Demo" width="100"/>
</a>

### Demo with MMDetection

For more complex scenarios with multiple people, use the MMDetection-based demo:

```bash
python demo/topdown_demo_with_mmdet.py \
demo/mmdetection_cfg/rtmdet_m_640-8xb32_coco-person.py \
https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmpose/rtmdet_m_8xb32-100e_coco-obj365-person-235e8209.pth \
configs/body_2d_keypoint/topdown_probmap/coco/td-pm_ProbPose-small_8xb64-210e_coco-256x192.py \
path/to/pre-trained/weights.pth \
--input demo/resources/CropCOCO_multi_example.jpg \
--draw-bbox \
--output-root demo/results/ \
--draw-heatmap
```

Expected result (click for full size):  
<a href="demo/resources/multi_demo_result.jpg">
    <img src="demo/resources/multi_demo_result.jpg" alt="Multi Person Demo" width="100"/>
</a>

For more detailed information on demos and visualization options, please refer to the [MMPose documentation](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/inference.html).
